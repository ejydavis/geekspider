This is a bare-bones implementation of a web scraper to get an interesting link about algorithms from the website Geeks for Geeks.

The spider utilizes the Scrapy library and can be run with the script:

scrapy runspider geekspider.py

A function hidden from the repo emails formatted contents of the spider to my email address on a daily basis.
